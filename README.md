# Making music and playing Bass Guitar is what I live for

Playing an instrument is a discipline and like all disciplines it takes practice.
Learning music and continuously playing songs is how I get the most mileage out of my bass. Oftentimes I'll be learning new scales, inversions, and arpeggios. Scales are the building blocks of Western music. Inversions & arpeggios and are essentially ways to learn your scales inside out which is important because the ultimate goal of playing an instrument in my opinion is to be able to play anything you hear.
